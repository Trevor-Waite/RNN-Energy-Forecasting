RNN Energy Forecasting
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are called recurrent because they perform the same computations for all elements in a sequence of inputs. RNNs are becoming very popular due to their wide utility. They can analyze time series data, such as stock prices, and provide forecasts. In autonomous driving systems, they can anticipate car trajectories and help avoid accidents. They can take sentences, documents, or audio samples as input, making them extremely useful for natural language processing (NLP) systems, such as automatic translation, speech-to-text, or sentiment analysis. It can be applied in situations where you have a sequences of “events” with events being a data point.

This project investigates the use of RNN's in forecasting energy demand. In conclusion, it seems that RNN is outclassed by SARIMA and Fbprophet due to accuracy and its long training times. 

I plan to further investigate RNN in time series data forecasting in the future, possbily using an external GPU or AWS to speed up training times.
